# Divine Vision - Comparative Analysis for Image Caption Generation for Indian-Deities

The project includes a comparative analysis of five different models: ResNet50, ResNet152, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2. The analysis evaluates the performance of these models using metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BLEU scores. Based on the evaluation, DenseNet201 emerged as the most accurate model for caption generation among the five. The project utilizes DenseNet201 in the Flask backend for caption generation.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following technologies and frameworks:

- Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- https: A package for creating api calls to establish a communication medium b/w backend and frontend.
- [Divine Vision Mobile Application]()
- [Divine Vision Flask Server](https://github.com/Kaizoku01/Divine-Vision-Flask-Server)

## Conclusion
Based on the comparative analysis and evaluation metrics, DenseNet201 demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy for caption generation of Indian god and goddess images. Consequently, DenseNet201 was chosen for integration into the Flask backend of the mobile application.
